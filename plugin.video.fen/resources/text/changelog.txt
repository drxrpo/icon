Set to a high duration (1 Week) if you use only Fen for media viewing and rarely make changes on the Trakt website. Set to low duration (1 Hour) if you often use other add-ons for media viewing or often make changes on the Trakt website.
- New Tool "Clear Trakt Cache". Found in Tools==>Clear List and Data Info==>Clear Trakt Cache. Also found in "Next Episode Manager". This will clear the Trakt cache if needed.

- Fixed some playback issues.
- Remade and re-added Autoplay Next Episode. Setting appears in the 'Playback' tab once Autoplay has been enabled.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.01[/B][/COLOR]
- New Icon for add-on after well justified complaints about the original ghastly looking icon.
- Added 'Refresh Add-on Icon' to Tools Menu. If I change the icon for the add-on, you can press this to load the new icon. If the new icon doesn't show after, then restart Kodi.
- Some changes to Migration Tool. I will keep the tool around a little longer due to problems with Trakt API on day of performing the rename.
- There will be at least one more update to Furk It (1.2.36), to fix a couple of problems so a stable version is on the github. All future development will be through Fen.
- Old module dependencies will be removed from github when stable Furk It is updated.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.28[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.27[/B][/COLOR]

- Other code cleanup.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.26[/B][/COLOR]
- 'Dialog' results display now shows simple results pop-up, instead of extra info like poster etc to speed up the showing of results when 'Dialog' chosen.
- New setting in General/Navigation to enable/disable Kodi's built-in 'cacheToDisc' function. (Enabled by default)
- [B]###INFO FOR cacheToDisc...:###[/B]
    - cacheToDisc is a Kodi setting that makes Kodi cache the directory you are viewing. If you then hit 'next page', and load the next page of entries, then Kodi has the previous page cached so if you hit 'back' it won't need to remake the list items again. It makes backing out of a list of pages quicker.
    - A bug in Kodi 18 means that the cacheToDisc of previous pages don't keep their watched status, meaning any watched media will all of a sudden not display the watched indicator when navigating back to them. Disabling 'cacheToDisc' will fix that, with the trade-off that backing out of pages of media will be slower.
    - This setting does not affect Furk It's caching of information, it just stops Kodi caching pages as you browse. 

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.25[/B][/COLOR]
- Added option for using season titles when available. Now defaults to classic 'Season X' naming.

- Added [B]bold[/B] to all Furk It context menu items when browsing movies and TV Shows/Seasons/Episodes to better distinguish them from the largely useless regular Kodi context menu items that can no longer be removed by add-ons.
- Changed Extended Info context menu item call to always use tmdb_id to assure accurate results.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.11[/B][/COLOR]

    - You can now download Easynews and External source results.

    - If FURK result is a PACK, both 'Download Archive' and 'Download File' is available. Choosing Archive will download the entire archive file into the Furk Downloads folder. Selecting File will download the appropriate single file from that PACK. i.e. If you scraped The Walking Dead S01E01, and you select 'Download File' for a PACK result, it will only download the S01E01 file from within the PACK into the 'TV Downloads' folder. Selecting 'Download Archive' will download the entire archive into the 'Furk Downloads' folder.
    - Other fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.88[/B][/COLOR]
- Partial rewrite of sources.py.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.87[/B][/COLOR]
- Improved Easynews quality detection.

- Added color highlight settings for Furk It Scrapers. Choose colors for all three Furk It Scrapers (Local, Furk and EasyNews).
- Changed 'DOWNLOADING' label to 'ACTIVE' when an uncached torrent is being downloaded by Furk. (Missed that request before.)

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.84[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed resume selection if auto resolve or autoplay set (Kodi 18 bug).
- Removed Universal Scrapers Fallback Search option.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.83[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'DOWNLOADING' flag to uncached results that are being downloaded by Furk.

It is designed to be a visual representation of what Furk is currently downloading for you, rather than necessarily a to the minute representation.
- Fixed number of files display for My Furk Files.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.82[/B][/COLOR]
- Added remove download from list (select file when in My Furk Active Downloads to delete the download).

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.80[/B][/COLOR]
- Preliminary support for Uncached Torrents added. (Uncached currently only available from media search results i.e. through Movie or TV Show menus, not directly through Furk Menus. This will change but I was short of time.)

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.79[/B][/COLOR]
- Added airdate format setting choice (Day-Month-Year, Year-Month_Day, Month-Day-Year). Thanks tknorris, wherever you are.
- POSSIBLY fixed Manage In Progress Shows.
- Fixed 'Include Airdate in Title' from Tools.
- PROBABLY fixed color issues with Next Episode.
- HOPEFULLY FINALLY Fixed Furk API issues on first use.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.78[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed search history. (Moved history to database storage from settings storage. Still don't know why it stopped working.)
- Remade Next Episodes. (Could be buggy, but I hope not.)
- ABOUT NEXT EPISODES:
**It is made to work with either Trakt watched history or watched history coming directly from the add-on. Whichever source you have set up for your watched indicators (Trakt or Furk It), that is the source Next Episodes will use.
** Select 'Include Trakt Watchlist / Next Episode Unwatched' to include the first episode of every show you have in your watchlist.If you're not using Trakt, you can add unwatched shows to Next Episodes via the Add/Remove context menu item that appears for Movies and TV Shows.
** Settings for Next Episodes can be accessed through the normal settings, through Tools==>Manage Next Episode Options or through the Context Menu when inside Next Episodes. I always like to have quick ways of getting to relevant settings. These settings include a 'Manage In Progress Shows'. If you are using Trakt for your watched indicators, then this screen allows you to 'Hide' shows directly through the add-on, without having to go to the trakt site to do it. Shows in the 'Manage In Progress Shows' menu will have [EXCLUDED] in front of them if they are hidden in Trakt, and [INCLUDED] if they are not. Simply selecting a show will toggle it's hidden setting; click a hidden show to unhide it, click an unhidden show to hide it. You can also browse into the show through the context menu if you want to see what episodes you've watched etc. All these options are available if you do not have a Trakt account, Furk It keeps local databases of watched media and hidden statuses etc for people without a Trakt account.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.77[/B][/COLOR]
- Playback changes for proper subtitle support.
- Added multi-year search term for movies.
- Download changes to settings and notification behaviour.
- Settings menus options when navigating through add-on simplified as Kodi 18 does not navigate to a specific setting correctly.
- Reorder settings slightly.
- NOTE: Movie and TV Show search history broken. I have no idea why as Furk Video and Audio history still works and uses exactly the same function. I've given up for today and will fix it tomorrow!

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.76[/B][/COLOR]
- Trimmed Download settings titles, fixed Download folder icons.
- Added Notification options for Downloads (Every 10%, Constant, Off).

- Added half second delay when opening settings from within add-on (Might fix settings.xml reset problem).
- Change single Download folder to Movie Downloads, TV Show Downloads and Furk Downloads. Each needs to be assigned their own folder in settings.
- ABOUT DOWNLOADS: When getting results from the Movie or TV Show menus, you must navigate down to the final file within any package so as the file saves in the correct folder. i.e. You need the Context Menu to display 'Download File' and not 'Download Archive' so as to save in the correct Movie or TV Show folder. Any file downloaded from within the Furk menus (My Furk Files, Furk Searches etc) will save straight to the Furk Downloads folder, as will any Archive files (season packs or archives from Furk search results).
- Added Download Submenus for browsing new Download Folders.
- Added default tmdb api key. Please replace in settings if you have your own.

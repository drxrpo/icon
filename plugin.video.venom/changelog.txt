[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.4 - July 09, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed poster art in source select list.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Watched indicator improvements.  Still it seems Kodi has
    random failures causing you to back out and go
    back in. Episode watched indicators were
    previousely broken due to some typos, that is
    now fixed.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.3 - July 07, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed UpNext broken if using new option to "Disable
    Extended artwork".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed fanart.tv request when using IMDb.  It seems fanart.tv
    has been dropping some title ID's so the response
    would not return any artwork.  Perfect example is
    Bohemian Rhapody.  Two weeks ago this title had
    plenty of extended artwork and now it's gone.  Upon
    reviewing the api call the TMDb_ID is still there but
    IMDb has been removed.  Now I check for this and
    pass TMDb ID if "error" in api response.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.2 - July 06, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed IMDb user key issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new option to "Disable Extended artwork(fanart.tv).
    This helps shorten some menu load times at the loss
    of extra poster, extra fanart, clearart and discart.  I've
    set this up to gather at a min poster and fanart from
    either IMDb, TMDb, or TVDb.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed some setting options from "enum" type to
    "select" type.  Instead of having to arrow through the
    options you will now have a pop up list to show you
    all available options in one shot. Options with only
    2 items I left as "enum" type.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.1 - July 03, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed caching of Trakt Progress list. Data should now
    refresh and be current instantly[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed two missing Default icons from last update.  Also
    added a bunch more to now use skin Default styles.
    Best seen with Aura skin.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option "Page Item Limit".  You can now
    set the number of list items per page for Movies and
    TV Shows. Note TMDb api default left at 20 so this
    new option works for IMDb and Trakt lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed occasional File Lock issue under
    some conditions.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed query jump to ResolveURL settings page for PM
    and RD due to new snappylink added to ResolveURL.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.0 - June 28, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed Trakt sync notice at startup.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New icon and menu label system.  You can now set the icon
    style based on Traditional icons or Meta Provider Logos.
    You can also add the Meta Provider label to the menu
    item .. ex (TMDb).  This helps distinguish between.. ex
    "Popular (IMDb) and Popular (TMDb)[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.9 - June 27, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed dict key preventing player from starting in OpenMeta.[/I]

    calendar.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.8 - June 24, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed old depreciated infoLabel that effected some
    menus showing the watched indicator when in fact the
    episode was not watched. Most notable was Trakt
    Progress. This made the side panel options work in
    reverse when flipping watched to unwatched.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added traceback to a number of new locations.

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.7 - June 22, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed bad key references in metadata.db[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] fixed multiple issues with provider cache calls from
    sources.py file, no .commit() and no .close() used for db
    access.  Multiple iterate of Nonetype objects fixed....hope
    this fixes your Fire OS devices.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added SeasonTotals to set.Property(), used
    by some skins[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.6 - June 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] fixed listitems and playlist not closing when using "Play from
    Here" or starting playback from inside the "Playlist Manager"
    -"View Playlist"[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new Bookmark cache clear option[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed resume bookmark to yes-no dialog to deal
    with occasional bug in contextmenu[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a notification when you stop a movie, or episode,
    that a resume point, and timestamp, was saved if bookmarks are enabled[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed functionality of Episode counters.  Previously if
    you watched an entire season the season list would change
    to a watched indicator only.  Now the episode count will be
    remain visible regardless of watch count.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Special Seasons, or Season 0, from not being displayed.
    Adjusted episode counter to take this Season 0 into account for
    totals[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.5 - June 2, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Movie Collection sorting controlled in settings[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed cache duration[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.4 - June 1, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a new Playlist Manager to context menu for none
    directory type list items.  You can add, remove, view playlist,
    and clear entire playlist.  For directory list items I added the
    playlist viewer and playlist clear options.  I suggest using
    the existing "Add to playlist" option for full shows and seasons[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.3 - May 28, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Source list now utilizes multiline list items. Settings
    contain option to turn this on or off base on your preference.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added a few more networks to TV Shows[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.2 - May 22, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added check for valid debrid account to sources.py. Code
    to remove duplicate links broke if no debrid account.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added discart to movies from fanart.tv[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added Trakt "Box Office" to movies.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added Navigation controls to settings page to
    turn off dupliacte movie and tv shows from IMDb, TMDb, and Trakt.
    May add more.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added option to Tools menu to reset View Types to default.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.1 - May 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Switched startup notice from news to changelog. Should
   have been done in 2.9.0 but missed it.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.0 - May 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed typo from adding 4k artwork and killed off low res, fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed changelog file to be local and now using newsinfo
    file remotely to pass update info of what's in the works.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.9 - May 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed some broken artwork and studio info for TV Shows "Networks".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added clearart and clearlogo to "Networks". Will display in player.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Trakt watched sync as startup service if valid account.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.8 - May 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reworked TV Show Networks. I discovered that all exo forks parse the
     tvmaze web page titled "This seasons Shows".  If your expecting to find a show
    like HBO's Boardwalk Empire you won't because it's ended, or discontinued. I've
    modified this to parse not only that web page but also the page for "All shows".
    There is now a settings page option to control which method you'd like.  The new
    "All shows" brings in allot more now.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Previous update I adjusted the artwork retrieved to be based
    on like count but only tackled movies at the time.  TV Shows is now included.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.7 - May 16, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few more cache duration tweaks.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a few new TV Networks, Hulu long overdue.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] A big redo of Fanart.tv retrieved artwork.  Artwork is now retrieved based
     on number of likes received as priority throughout.  This means artwork could
    occasionally change.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] updated TMDb's api for soon to be phased out "releases" query parameter,
    replaced by "release_dates".  This updated a good deal of titles certificate/ratings[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.6 - May 14, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks for TV shows this time.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb TV Shows and the results
    are more trustworthy. This allowed me to tweak the cache duration time to 24hrs
    without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb's Upcoming to Movie menu[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed TMDb Movie Collections to use new tmdb.py indexer[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.5 - May 12, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks. Extended artwork was causing a failure for some titles
    and list return was not the 20 items, TMDb provides, who's noticed? Extended fanart
    was braking 1-2 titles per page.  That's resolved and each Movie page now yields
    20 items from api response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb movies at this time and the
    results are more trustworthy, TV Shows next then onto IMDb. This allowed me to
    tweak the cache duration time to 24hrs without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] 4k fanart inclusion, previously only 1920 width was allowed and lately many titles
    are 4k fanart only so this was a must change as I noticed the decrease in fanart in
    the interface.  May cause a slight lag and considering adding a 4k fanart option to
    turn this off. Downside is  you will lose some if you turn it off so it's hard coded for
    now as always on[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.4 - May 9, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few TMDb api fixes for missing meta.  Some genre and mpaa cases were dropped
    due to format issues. Some TV Shows runtime/duration returned  more than one
    value so now we index just the first case and this stops seeing "0".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new request function to add a sleep/wait state for TMDB's api to limit the
    number of pop up notifications when rate-limiter is hit.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More code changes and soon the infamous worker() and super_info() functions
    will be gone. They break as many list items as they create![/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.3 - May 8, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to TV Shows.  Please note TMDb's api is rate limited to 40
    list items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this limit and to please
    wait! Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in TV Show lists to indicate IMDb, Trakt,or TMDb for better
    knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Dutch language choice to api[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed thread issue with large User/Watch lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TMDb now has it's own py file and as I move towards separate files for indexing
    TMDb, Trakt, IMDb, and TVDb I have chosen to store these files in the "Indexers"
    folder. As a result all menu navigation py files have been moved to a new "Menu"
    folder.  Some old files were not removed in last update and this has now been
    corrected.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.2 - May 7, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to movies.  Please note TMDb's api is rate limited to 40 list
    items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this limit and to please wait!
    Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in movies list to indicate IMDb, Trakt, or TMDb for better
    knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I may scrap all efforts on future TMDb development as I'm not impressed with the
    rate limiter issue and honestly the lists are near identical to IMDb so what's the freakin
    point other than a cluttered interface?! Opinions  welcome!  So it's not yielding brownie
    points thus far with me.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.1 - May 3, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Now using Openscrapers for source providers! Torrent min  seeder option now part
    of Openscraper settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Some accounts moved to Openscrapers, remaining unused accounts have
    been removed[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed settings page category "Accounts" to "API Keys" to follow what stricly
    now resides there[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.0 - April 30, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New Notification function for additional info.  Default InfoDialog() reported
    Addon Name as heading/Title, and now reports Movie, show, or Episode info if added to
    Trakt etc.  Also turned off annoying sounds for anything other than errors.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.9 - April 29, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new options to Trakt Manager, Watched, Unwatched, Rate, and Unrate.
    Main function of List items now in Bold and Color to stand out[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Play" options.  Now when set to "Auto Play". Then
    context menu will have option called "Source Select" to override "AutoPlay", formerly
    "Play using..", made little sense what the function did. Works  in reverse if default play
    action is "Directory" you'll see "Auto Play"  as usual[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Queue Item" to "Add to Playlist" to better follow suit
    with new playlist options coming soon[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.8 - April 26, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Scaper fix, 3 Torrents fixed.  Due to number of links being pulled default is now
